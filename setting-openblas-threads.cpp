//To set the number of threads in OpenBLAS using the openblas_set_num_threads function in C++, you can follow these steps:


#include <cblas.h>

//2.Call the openblas_set_num_threads function and pass the desired number of threads as an argument:
openblas_set_num_threads(num_threads);

/*3.Replace num_threads with the desired number of threads you want to use for parallel execution. 
For example, if you want to set it to 4, you would use*/
openblas_set_num_threads(4);.

//4.Make sure to link against the OpenBLAS library when compiling your code.
g++ your_code.cpp -lopenblas

/*By setting the number of threads using openblas_set_num_threads, you can control the parallel execution of OpenBLAS operations in your C++ code.

Note that the openblas_set_num_threads function sets the number of threads globally for OpenBLAS, which may affect other parts of your program that use OpenBLAS.*/
