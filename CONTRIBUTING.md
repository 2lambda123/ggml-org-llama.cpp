# Contributing Guidelines

* If the pull request only contains documentation changes (e.g., updating
READMEs, adding new wiki pages), please add `[no ci]` to the commit title. This will skip unnecessary CI checks and help reduce build times.
* When squashing multiple commits on merge, use the following format for your commit title: `<module>:<commit title> (#<issue_number>)`. For example: `utils: Fix typo in utils.py (#1234)`
