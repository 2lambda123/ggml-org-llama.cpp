To set the number of threads in OpenBLAS using the openblas_set_num_threads function in C++, you can follow these steps:

1. Include the OpenBLAS header file in your C++ code:
#include <cblas.h>

2.Call the openblas_set_num_threads function and pass the desired number of threads as an argument:
openblas_set_num_threads(num_threads);

3.Replace num_threads with the desired number of threads you want to use for parallel execution. 
For example, if you want to set it to 4, you would use openblas_set_num_threads(4);.

4.Make sure to link against the OpenBLAS library when compiling your code. The specific way to do this depends on your build system or compiler command. For example, if you are using g++ on Linux, you can add the -lopenblas flag to the compilation command:
g++ your_code.cpp -lopenblas

By setting the number of threads using openblas_set_num_threads, you can control the parallel execution of OpenBLAS operations in your C++ code.

Note that the openblas_set_num_threads function sets the number of threads globally for OpenBLAS, which may affect other parts of your program that use OpenBLAS. If you want to limit the number of threads only for specific parts of your code, you can use other methods like OpenMP directives (omp_set_num_threads) or other threading libraries.

Remember to consult the OpenBLAS documentation and the specific requirements of your project to ensure the proper usage of threading and optimize performance accordingly.
