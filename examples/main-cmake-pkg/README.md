# llama.cpp/example/main-cmake-pkg

This program builds the [main](../main) application using a relocatable CMake package. It serves as an example of using the `find_package()` CMake command to conveniently include [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) in projects which live outside of the source tree.
