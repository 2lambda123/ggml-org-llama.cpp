 I want today to think about something very specific, namely intellectual property in the specific context of images that are generated by artificial intelligence in the style of a particular artist. Let's just review the process. I've come to the page in the past, some artist and I still remember the name as rather than a great artist, created a place of painting. A little painting comes down to us, most of them, usually. And in many cases, each artist has a particular style, which makes his work identifiable. And if you have enough about art and can't pretend to, if I do, but if you do not, you can look at the painting and you can say this is a round of mouth or round of whatever it would be. With at least some hope of being right, although there have been so many forgeries that have been authenticated by the supposed art experts that want us to sometimes wonder whether these people know how much they pretend to do, but anyway, I'll leave that for something. And just think instead about this corpus of work, which, much of which is now in the public domain, even if only as images, so that the works are owned by galleries and individuals, they're sometimes brought together for the exhibition. And the exhibition produces a catalogue, often, and the catalogue contains pretty well everything the artist has ever produced. I have a lot of nice thick volume, which I got from the Van Gogh Museum, and it comes to that, which has got pretty much everything in here. Well, not have a painting because some of it is lost, but certainly the things that we have are all there. So, now that these paintings are in the public domain, the question that arises, why shouldn't you use them to train an AI that we want to teach how to make art images from other images, and then you can text the diffusion model that we described in several episodes. So you collect together an enormous body of work, you label it so that all the Van Goghs, the Van Goghs, and whatever. And when you've done all that, you train the AI on the images, and if you're skillful enough and have enough resources, you end up with a model. But when asked to produce art in the style of Matisse Kandinsky Rembrandt Leonardo, there's a reasonable shot at doing exactly that, more than reasonable, certainly, to the uninitiated, to the untrained eye, in expert eye. I think most of it is very difficult to distinguish from the real thing. So we now have our AI that can create images in a particular style. And we give it a completely different image, perhaps that you've drawn yourself and give yourself, and you get it to imitate somebody. Hello? Hello. A brown lab. So let's now suppose that we have an original work of art, perhaps I've drawn it myself, or I've used some means to devise it. But it isn't in any style at all. And I ask stable diffusion, or dowel, e, or mid-journey, or whatever they might be. I ask them to produce 50 images in the style of Kandinsky and off, losing void, whoever. And after a few minutes, probably a bit quicker than that one of us, probably a few minutes, we have these images. And they are, of course, all of them fake. So if they're all fake, are they? Let's say they're images of maggreet, which I'd be playing with this morning. Are they maggreet or are they not? Well, clearly they're not maggreet in the sense that he didn't paint them. Nobody painted them. They don't exist as oil paints. Although I'm sure somebody one day would be clever enough to program some sort of robot arm to create a real oil painting based on this sort of thing, maybe that's another story. So they are real images identifiably in the style of maggreet, same colors, same ways of putting shapes and objects into the frame, but they're clearly not maggreet. And this is where they're holding intellectual property paint. I think they've done interesting. Please remember, firstly, I am not a lawyer. I have no expertise in this at all. So they don't take anything that I'm saying is grounds for action, as I say in the courts, because it's almost certainly not quite right. But I did have this discussion this morning with several chat bots. Most of them seem to think that I'm roughly right. And I'm roughly right in saying the following things. First of all, you cannot copyright or patent an image. Sorry, let me start with that again. You cannot copyright or patent an idea. The idea must be instantiated. It must actually be a piece of writing, a painting, an object, a machine, something that does something tangible. And then you can claim copyright on the painting artist's work writing or whatever it might be. And you can claim patent on your invention, on your machine or whatever it might be. And I know most circumstances you would be granted. But you can't claim a copyright of an idea. You can't claim copyright. But the style of at least so the AI is telling me, because style is so amorphous and indeed it's changeable. But just as we know that so many, many different periods in his life, most artists do, the question of whose style this is, and when is this style not this style? When is this in the image of what it is and when is it in style? These are not trivial questions at all. Because it becomes sort of how long is a piece of string. Anyway, I've been said to the AI that I was talking about till it was time to war. Yes, but suppose I'm a sharp lawyer, and I come up with this argument. This AI has produced a piece of artwork. So long as I look at my salary. Oh. And the typical prompt would be, when I was using with my greet this morning, paradoxical future, utopian style of my greet, that's all. And it was producing images by the dozen, all of which at least to my own tutor that I looked pretty like my greets, even though none of them were. Now, the argument goes like this. If the AI can produce something which to the untusad eye looks like my greet, just from the description or the request in the prompt style of my greet, then clearly it has been trained sufficiently on something which is sufficiently unique, identifiable, or let's say clearly defined, it has been trained on something sufficiently clearly defined, or there to be something, therefore, that we can call the style of my greet. And in many respects, I think whatever the law may say, that style is more is legacy than any particular painting, painted in that style. So, it's just seen as in the people, famously, it's been imitated in all sorts of ways, but they are not my greets, even if that is. And so we have a very peculiar situation here, which is that the thing that is most characteristic of my greet, in English, as you might say, really defines his legacy, is something that you can't copyright. But if a time were to come, and this is where it all starts to get more and more convoluted, if a time were to come, when my greet, original my greet, which of course have been sold, although I really don't know, but I imagine for millions, if it's in the case of Van got hundreds of millions, every original my greets have been sold for millions. But a time comes when you can just buy fraudulent my greets on every street corner, in every shop counter, in every supermarket. Then, is there a danger that the original will be devalued? Well, you could argue that they might become more valuable, precisely because they are the originals, but who knows? And if we were put adventure to be able to make real oil paintings, or acrylics, or whatever they are, so my greets, if we were able to do that, so that someone could have something hanging on their wall that looked like an original my greet, or might even be a unique piece of work, in the sense that the person who made it got a robot arm to paint it, but then, a bit like the Internet of Things, the NFT's non-frangible tokens, I think they're called, gave a guarantee that that particular artwork would never be reproduced, other than perhaps in a photograph, but certainly not as a photograph. Then what? Well, there's a whole separate question here, which is, why does the original, why do the originals come on such extraordinary prices, if their imitators are just as good? Well, this, of course, has been an argument in art in decades, centuries, and it's to do with the importance of value, as a result of the originator, the person who creates the style, who's done more than those who copied it, copying is much easier than creating, much easier than creating it. Now, maybe so. So what if it is so? If I have an indistinguishable oil painting on my wall that looks like an agreed, everyone thinks is an agreed, and I like just as much as an agreed, but I knock it up in my garden shed on the basis of what I've been describing, then I may be perfectly happy with it. Indeed, I am never likely to be in a position where I could afford a real microwave anyway, so nothing's lost. I'm not depriving anyone of millions because I got this hanging on my wall, quite the reverse. Hello. But somebody could argue that I've in a sense devalued the currency, you know, a little bit like somebody saying, "I'm forging banknotes, why does that matter?" After all, who does it harm? Well, the answer is it harms everybody because you're devaluing the currency, you're making a piece of paper that's supposed to be worth so much, worth less because they're substantially more of them. Notes are essentially bearer of securities. I promise to pay the bearer on demand for some of one pound, five pounds, 20 pounds. It means this piece of paper is worth in exchange. Exactly that. So if I have a genuine Margret, which should be worth millions, if it's a false Margret, it's probably worth next to nothing. But if there are so many false Margretes that nobody is interested in owning a real one because the invitations are just as good, then you could reach a situation where nobody was prepared to pay for the originals. I'll show the argument that they become more valuable because they're original. Nobody's interested in paying for the originals because they can have one that's just as good. Looks just as good, gives them just as much enjoyment for next to nothing. All right. But what about the argument that says that the whole thing is in any case ludicrously in places and that the fact that people are prepared to pay absurd sums of money, I think they have absurd sums of money, but it's a sort of false market in my view, but people are prepared to pay huge sums of money to have something when they can have something that looks just as good to all but the expert eye for next to nothing. And so then the argument becomes why is originality valued or should it be? Why do we value originals so much and frankly copies so little, although there are now copies that have their own market because some of the copies aren't regarded in themselves as artworks, masterpieces? The chap that copied Turner, whose name momentarily escapes me, is now very collectible. Just as we said the other day, you heard Van Gogh in seeking to exhibit in the sense of show Gauguin, and his brother Theo, what he'd been painting, did a few pencil sketches of his art and those pencil sketches are now as sought after of the art itself, because it's a Van Gogh. But if I produce 20 Van Goghs on my computer in three and a half minutes, most people being unable to distinguish them from the real thing, where exactly does the justification for all of this originate? Well, I think I've probably given what the most plausible, which is that the mind that creates the masterpiece in the first place has, in some sense or other, laid hold on a possibility in the universe. Now I'm going to say something else here, which you may think a bit fanciful, but let me just indulge myself a moment here. To repeat the diffusion process, we take an image and we add noise, but we don't just add noise in one trajectory so that we end up with one noisy image, which looks like nothing to the naked eye. We actually do it over and over again, so that we end up with thousands. And I've said in previous episodes, this is what's called latent space. Now if we do that, each of those points could, if we chose it, be denoised into an image. I'm not just into one image, but into many images, so if you just imagine what's going on here, we take one image. We create, let's keep the numbers down, it's basically a thousand points in latent space, every one of which is the end point of a journey of noising the original image. So one image is given rise to a thousand images, or not images, but a thousand points, which are its descendants. If each of those points could itself be made into another thousand images that are vaguely related to the original parent image by denoising, then that gives you a million images from the first image. And you only need to make the numbers bigger, make the first latent space of noisy images a million, and make each one of those capable of being denoised into a million, and you end up with a trillion possible images from one image. And pretty quickly, the universe gets exhausted with these possibilities, so, and you may start to hear some echoes here, so, what is the value of one particular image? When we've started with an image, we've noised it, we've picked one point from a million points in latent space, and we've denoised it into one of a million images that it could give rise to, then we end up with one image from our original image, out of a trillion images that we could have ended up with. Those other images are what we might call counterfactual conditionals. They are what might have been just as in our lives. Every decision that we make, every footfall that I'm making in this walk is defining a trajectory that will in its turn eliminate many other trajectories. It's inevitable. I could have been an incalculable number of different people. I could now and probably will become another person during the rest of my life. We can't have everything. We can't actualise, realise in the sense of make real. We can't make real every possible eventuality from every possibility that arises. Because if we did, we would soon need more bits than there is information in the universe. The story for another day. The latent space thing is very much like life. You can't do everything. You can't be everyone you could possibly be. You can't do or say or paint or write everything you could possibly write. So a key question here is why does, and this is of course coming back to where we started, why does the fact that Matisse or Van Gogh, or for that matter, one such as myself, chooses to instantiate one particular trajectory such as the trajectory that this episode of this podcast has taken, why does the fact that I have made a decision? My brain has made a decision because I'm not really thinking about it. It's just tumbling out of my mouth one word after another. Why does that, in as much as it instantiates one of millions of possibilities, literally trillions? Why does that, or not why does that, does that grant it automatically some kind of superior status? Does the fact that this podcast has been brought into the world, has been realized, does that make it more significant, more valuable? Thinking about art again, I'm not just in the monetary sense. Then any other podcast that I might have recorded, if I've got out of bed ten minutes later, or from the other side, or had a different night's sleep or dream, does it make any difference? And I'm not sure that I'm completely ready to say yes it does, because I'm not sure that the happenstance of this particular episode, having come into the world, is any more deliberate and intentional in the narrow sense than what an artist ends up painting, although I have to say that artists don't just paint. The point is when the point was made in Melvin Brown's program about him that Van Gogh agonised over his paintings, and it's mythology to think that he was a tortured soul who painted out of his madness, in fact when he was mad he couldn't paint at all, as those on the show made very clear So he deliberately chose, but you have to say, well yes of course, but you deliberately choose not so much because you think, not necessarily because you think, but this brushstroke is better than that brushstroke, but because you have to do something, and to do nothing is to suffer the worst kind of writer's block, because the fact that you could put any word you like to follow on from what you've written so far can immobilise you, and of course this what comes next aspect of AI is exactly the same thing, exactly the same thing, that it is a mechanism for carrying on the doing the next thing, for filling in the gaps, for saying what comes next, and artists and musicians and sculpters Everybody, you'll do it, we may not do it with any pretensions to being in a creative mood, but we go through the day, and as we go through the day we instantiate one trajectory of millions that could, of things being equal, have transpired So to come back to my paintings, yes I mean I could go home, and I could run my fake Matisse programme a thousand times during the rest of the afternoon, and I could come up with literally thousands, six thousand, ten thousand, twelve thousand Quasai, Matisse's, Quasai Kandinsky's, Quasai Van Goss, all of which would be just a little bit different, none of which would have been created with any real intent, purpose, none of them would have been created with the purpose of saying something profound about the human condition, which of course is what we like to think great art does, whether or not it really does is another story So I could do that, but even if I did that, even if I went home and produced a million Quasai Matisse's, it would still only be an insignificant fraction of those that could be made from the latent space that emerges from just one image And so to go on and on and on, creating and displaying these images, it's tempting to stick them all on Facebook and try and crash Zuckerberg's servers, but we're not going to do that, to do this It really does water down the medium, and I think that everybody would start suffering from Matisse fatigue very quickly, as indeed anybody that's been following my Facebook page probably knows I've been laboring this point, so that everybody's sick and tired of my images But, as I never tire of saying, I've been producing them for a reason, and the reason is really to explore exactly the topic that we've just been discussing for the bit apart of half an hour Why is this important, special, just because it's what Matisse or Van Gogh or Rembrandt actually painted? Why does it matter? Why do we care so much? Why do we value these things so much? And ordinarily much, one might be... Well, there's an old saying, which my mother had on a pottery jug in the kitchen, better do one thing than dream all things I mean, I think it's worse than dreaming all things, it's trying to do all things, where you try to produce every conceivable Matisse, there is no such set, it isn't even countable The same reason that real numbers are not countable Well, it has been a bit of a ramble chat, but I think it's been a ramble chat of some considerable importance and significance, even if it's inconclusive Because it does strike me that there are some things going on here that go to the very heart of the human condition, but go to the heart of saying, you know, you can't do everything Not even in your wildest dreams can you do everything? So make your mind up, what you really want to do, what you really want to be, what you really want to invest the time that you've got on Because that will define the trajectory of your life, just as the decisions that artists make with their brushes and writers make with their pens, define the trajectory of a painting or a story And you can say to me, as you probably will are, but you see AI is just blindly people laundering the possibilities of the latent space without any intention, without any meaning But you can't say that, you really can't because it's been trained on a training data set and in a context That means that it's neural net is in very large measure an embodiment of the whole of human experience and culture So that it chooses certain things over others isn't meaningless, isn't random, isn't empty Any more than what you and I choose is arbitrary, random, meaningless or entity None of that is true, none of that follows That we have for good or ill, for good or ill, remember that, for good or ill, done this, said that, written this, painted that, composed this, whatever it might be That we have done it is a contribution to the trajectory of the universe and certainly to human history And I think that if you've got a Van Gogh sunflower painting, there are four of them I think in the world on your wall, apart from being very wealthy You've got something that simply represents one of uncountably many possible paintings that he could have painted And there is in that a metaphor for existence Thank you for listening [sound of water splashing](Tokens used: 4608 / 7168)\

> Please summarise the document with those corrections in 10 bullet points.\
 Here are 10 bullet points summarizing the corrected text:\
\
- The text discusses intellectual property rights related to artificial intelligence (AI) generating images in a particular artist's style.\
- AI models can be trained on a corpus of work in the public domain, such as paintings by Van Gogh, and produce new works in that style.\
- However, these newly generated works are not considered originals by the law because they were not created by the original artist.\
- The text argues that the style of an artist is more their legacy than any particular painting, but it cannot be copyrighted.\
- If AI can produce indistinguishable copies of an artist's work in their style, it suggests that the training data was sufficiently unique and identifiable to constitute a "style."\
- The text explores whether the proliferation of AI-generated works in an artist's style could devalue the original works.\
- The value of originals is explored, with the argument that they represent a possibility in the universe that has been laid hold on by the artist.\
- The diffusion process is used to generate thousands of possible images from one image, and each of those points can be denoised into another thousand images, leading to trillions of possibilities.\
- The text asks why the fact that an original work has come into existence gives it superior status over other possibilities.\
- The text concludes by stating that every decision made instantiates one of millions or even trillions of possibilities and contributes to the trajectory of human history.\

> Why might someone prefer to own an original painting rather than an AI imitation, leaving aside the question of the painting's market value?\
 There are several reasons why someone might prefer to own an original painting rather than an AI imitation, even if they have similar visual qualities. Here are some possible reasons:\
\
1. **Emotional connection**: People often develop a personal connection with an original work of art that goes beyond its visual appeal. They might appreciate the history and context of the artwork, or feel a sense of admiration for the artist's skill and creativity. This emotional connection is difficult to replicate with an AI imitation.\
2. **Authenticity**: Original paintings are unique and authentic. They have a provenance and history that can be traced back to the artist who created them. In contrast, AI-generated works lack this sense of authenticity because they were not created by the original artist.\
3. **Rarity**: Original paintings are often rare and one-of-a-kind. This rarity can add to their appeal and value, especially if they are associated with a famous or respected artist. In contrast, AI-generated works can be easily replicated, which can dilute their perceived value and significance.\
4. **Experience**: Viewing an original painting in person can be a very different experience from viewing a digital reproduction or AI imitation. The texture, brushwork, and other physical qualities of the painting can add to its visual appeal and emotional impact.\
5. **Support for the artist**: Owning an original painting can also be seen as a way of supporting the artist and their work. By purchasing an original artwork, collectors are contributing to the artist's livelihood and helping to sustain their creative practice. In contrast, AI-generated works do not provide any direct financial benefit to the original artist.\
(Tokens used: 6034 / 7168)\
> Good, although apart from your last point all these points could also be made about an AI image: we can grow attached to any image; why does authenticity matter in the sense you mention if the result is indistinguishable; why does rarity matter except for the rather inglorious reason of wanting to own something nobody else owns; we will soon have robots that can replicate artistic technique including brushwork.\
 You raise valid points, and I agree that some of the factors I mentioned could also apply to AI-generated images in certain circumstances. However, here are some additional thoughts on why people might still prefer original paintings over AI imitations, even if they have similar visual qualities:\
\
1. **Emotional connection**: While it is possible to develop an emotional connection with any image, including AI-generated ones, the emotional resonance of an original painting can be deeper and more complex because it was created by a human being with their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. The artist's intent, emotion, and personal history can all contribute to the meaning and significance of the work, which can create a stronger emotional connection for some viewers.\
2. **Authenticity**: While AI-generated works may be indistinguishable from original paintings in terms of visual quality, they lack the authenticity that comes from being created by the original artist. For some people, this authenticity is an important factor in their appreciation and enjoyment of art. They may feel that owning an original work is a way of connecting with the artist and their creative process in a more direct and meaningful way.\
3. **Rarity**: While rarity is not the only reason to value original paintings, it can still be a significant factor for some collectors. Owning a unique and rare work of art can be seen as a mark of prestige and status, and can also increase the financial value of the work over time. In contrast, AI-generated works are infinitely replicable, which can dilute their perceived value and significance.\
4. **Experience**: While AI-generated images may be able to replicate certain aspects of an original painting's physical qualities, they cannot fully replicate the experience of viewing an original work in person. The texture, brushwork, and other physical qualities of a painting can all contribute to its visual appeal and emotional impact, and this experience is difficult to replicate with a digital image or AI imitation.\
5. **Support for the artist**: Owning an original painting can also be seen as a way of supporting the artist and their work, especially if they are still living and creating new works. By purchasing an original artwork, collectors are contributing to the artist's livelihood and helping to sustain their creative practice. In contrast, AI-generated works do not provide any direct financial benefit to the original artist.\
\
In summary, while some of the factors I mentioned earlier could also apply to AI-generated images, there are still several reasons why people might prefer original paintings over AI imitations, even if they have similar visual qualities. The emotional connection, authenticity, rarity, experience, and support for the artist are all important factors that can contribute to the meaning and significance of an original work of art, and these factors are difficult to replicate with an AI-generated image.\

> I have generated some AI images that are, if anything, superior to the works of the artist they imitate. In tha case of Magritte the diffusion model took an original image not by Magritte and produced some extraordinarily imaginative variations on it that took my breath away. Pity you can't see them!\
 That's fascinating to hear! It's remarkable how AI models like diffusion models can generate such high-quality and creative images, sometimes even surpassing the works of human artists. Here are a few thoughts on your experience:\
\
1. **Creativity**: AI models like diffusion models have the ability to generate incredibly imaginative and creative images, often in ways that humans might not think of. This can result in surprising and unexpected variations on an original image, as you experienced with your Magritte-inspired AI creations.\
2. **Limitless possibilities**: Unlike human artists, who are limited by their own skills, techniques, and physical abilities, AI models like diffusion models have the ability to generate a virtually limitless number of images. This can result in a wide range of variations and interpretations of an original image, allowing for endless exploration and experimentation.\
3. **Collaborative potential**: The ability of AI models to generate creative and imaginative images opens up new possibilities for collaboration between humans and machines. By working together, artists and AI models can create new works that combine the best of both worlds - the creativity and emotional resonance of human artistry with the technical prowess and limitless possibilities of AI.\
4. **Ethical considerations**: While AI-generated images can be incredibly impressive and creative, it's important to consider the ethical implications of using AI to imitate the style of a particular artist. As we discussed earlier, there are questions around ownership, authenticity, and market value that need to be considered when creating and distributing AI-generated works.\
