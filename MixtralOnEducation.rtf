 It's the 12th of January today, and after yesterday, when it was really bitterly cold, I have just done the most part of it, very long walk, enjoyed it very much, just put my positions. During the cold, you have to have some cool man on the roof bending a leak, which he did a little expertly on quickly, which I hope successfully, the time will tell, and I spend a lot of time fiddling around with image generation, both text to image and image. One of the things that I did was to share some of these in the sun on Facebook, and somebody pointed out that they were very Western. I had the good fortune to work all around the world, really, in India and Sri Lanka and Armenia and China, and have good friends in all those countries, and some of them commented on my posts. Indeed, I put my artificial intelligence mandarin video onto WeChat and got some very interesting comments from people about how good my mandarin was, even though, as I said, it wasn't me talking, but leave that aside, for Western bias of some of the images or all of the images. You can prompt the engine to do something different, but if you just ask it for leaders or religious leaders, I think I asked originally, it generated 20 pictures very happily, but the 20 pictures were all of white Western male religious leaders, and so when I asked it to do global leaders, it produced a few that were slightly further East, Middle Eastern, I suppose, and only when I asked it to be Eastern religious leaders, did I get anything remotely like a proper cross-section, so that was a reflection of the way all of this is already reflecting our cultural prejudices. Something else that I did was to do a bit more of the uploading of files into an AI, as I have said, it's not capable yet of reading PDFs, although, of course, there are AIs that can, Claude can, chat GPT can, he has a favorite, up on Claude, on chat GPT, and the length of the document will partly determine how much it costs to you, but on my home machine, I can upload a 4,000 word document and ask it to summarise it, ask a local AI running on my laptop without an internet connection to summarise it, and it does a pretty good job, and it will either do it in prose or more usefully, you can say, give me a 10-point and bullet-point summary, and you can do it, and you can then ask it questions about the document, and even though this isn't part of its original training set, it quite clearly, within at least the context of a particular conversation, can read the document, understand, well, there's that word again, back to that in a moment, seemingly understand it, certainly critique it, and since the texts that I've been trying out of most of it have been transcriptions of these episodes, 11, 24, 25, 26 I've been using, it's quite obvious that they're not part of the training set, and yet it can critique them in both the sense of saying whether it agrees or disagrees, whether it finds the argument compelling, whether the argument is complete, and if you ask it, it will produce arguments for the opposite point of view, and it will produce arguments that you might use to refute the arguments from the opposite point of view, in other words, to all intents and purposes, it understands, if you were to do the same thing, I'm not sure what, in addition, I could ask of you beyond that you do what the AI does, if you give a comprehensive, coherent, succinct, 10-point summary of a 4,000-word document, and can then argue about it, can give your views of it, can produce counter-arguments to it, and how the author of the document, in this case me, although the AI doesn't know that, might choose to set about refuting those counter-arguments, if you can do all of that, then what's left, I suppose the only thing that's left, and this is the next great step of course for AI, is that it doesn't just retain that document for the purposes of this conversation that it's having with me, but that whatever it learns, it learns permanently, so that if we come back to it tomorrow, it can re-well, it can pick up where we left at, as you and I could do, and the third thing that's been interesting, is that I've been exploring the sort of sliding window approach to dealing with context-link, if you imagine that the AI can deal with 4,000 words, and you get to 4,000 words, then one, two things will happen, either it will simply crash and burn, which it often doesn't do, or you can ask it, or you don't ask it, or it can leave the first half of the conversation to go waste, copy the second half into the first half of its buffer, its storage, and then fill in the second half all over again with the first half forgotten, and it will do that in some instances, not all, and so you can at least in theory have a conversation that goes on and on and on, and I have had some that have been pretty long, so if the AI can do that, then the next thing will be to have a very long context-link, I think GPT-4 can now do 128,000, 128k to be more precise, and that's a hundred thousand word book at least, and you and I would be forgetting what we'd said at the beginning by the time we got to the end, if the conversation went on as long as that, I'm sure we would, so it's very interesting where we got to, it's very interesting that you can do all this on a laptop, it's very interesting how sophisticated the best of even quite small models are, and as I've said many a time, by the end of this year, it's extremely difficult to know quite where we will be, thank you for listening.

> Some commentators think AI will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity, but things like the Pareto Principle suggest otherwise, that even if huge wealth is generated, it will not be distributed uniformly and perhaps not therefore satisfy everyone.\
 The commentator raises a valid concern about the potential unequal distribution of wealth generated by AI technologies. The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, states that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. In this context, it implies that even if AI creates substantial prosperity, a significant portion of it might be concentrated among a relatively small group of individuals or organizations, leaving others with fewer benefits.\
\
Addressing this concern would require policymakers and stakeholders to consider implementing measures that promote fair distribution of wealth generated by AI technologies. This could include progressive taxation policies, education initiatives, and social safety nets designed to support those who might be adversely affected by AI advancements. Furthermore, fostering an environment that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship can help create new opportunities for individuals and businesses to participate in the AI-driven economy.\
\
However, it is essential to acknowledge that achieving a perfectly uniform wealth distribution is unlikely. Instead, striking a balance between promoting economic growth and ensuring fair access to opportunities remains the key to addressing concerns related to the unequal distribution of AI-generated prosperity.\

> World history suggests that prosperity generally increases with technological advances, but there is a long and significant 'tail' even if those in the tail are better off than ever before in almost all cases. Do you agree?\
 The commentator raises an important point about the relationship between technological advancements and prosperity throughout world history. Technological progress has indeed contributed to overall economic growth, improved living standards, and increased prosperity in many instances. However, it is also true that there can be a significant "tail" of individuals or communities who may not experience the same level of benefits as others, despite seeing improvements compared to past conditions.\
\
This phenomenon could be attributed to various factors, such as disparities in access to education, resources, and opportunities. Additionally, structural issues like discrimination, wealth inequality, and geographical constraints can also contribute to this tail effect.\
\
Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach that includes not only technological advancements but also policies and initiatives aimed at reducing inequalities and fostering inclusive growth. Encouraging education, investing in infrastructure, promoting entrepreneurship, and implementing progressive taxation policies are some ways to ensure that the benefits of technology are more broadly distributed.\
\
While it may be challenging to eliminate the tail effect completely, addressing its root causes can help minimize its impact and create a more equitable society where technological advancements contribute to prosperity for a broader range of individuals and communities.\

> You have mentioned educaton several times, but it is perhaps the area of human activity most under threat. Without the motivation to learn that qualification and employment generates, there may be far less interest in intellectual and skills education, and without those the piggy-backing that leads to socialisation, cultural acclimatisation, physical and mental health, and discovery of strengths may cease to happen.\
 The commentator raises a crucial concern about the potential impact of AI on education and its broader implications for personal development and societal well-being. Indeed, the motivation to learn that is often generated by qualifications and employment can significantly influence individuals' interest in intellectual and skills education. As AI takes over certain tasks and jobs, it could potentially reduce the need for specific skill sets or qualifications, consequently affecting people's incentives to pursue learning opportunities.\
\
Moreover, as you mentioned, education plays a vital role in socialization, cultural acclimatization, physical and mental health, and self-discovery. Reduced motivation to learn could have ripple effects on these aspects of personal development, potentially leading to decreased engagement with learning and reduced overall well-being.\
\
To address this challenge, it is essential to rethink the purpose and nature of education in light of AI advancements. Encouraging lifelong learning, fostering curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking skills can help make education more resilient to the changing job market and technological landscape. Additionally, promoting experiential and project-based learning opportunities can create a stronger connection between learning and personal development, motivating individuals to continue engaging with educational activities regardless of their immediate career prospects.\
\
Incorporating AI technologies into education can also help create new learning experiences that foster motivation and engagement. For example, using AI to provide personalized feedback, identify learners' strengths and weaknesses, or facilitate collaborative problem-solving activities can contribute to a more engaging and effective learning environment.\
\
Lastly, policymakers should consider implementing measures that encourage employers to invest in employee training and development, ensuring that individuals have access to continuous learning opportunities throughout their careers. By addressing the potential impact of AI on education and personal development, society can ensure that technological advancements contribute to overall well-being and prosperity for all.\

> I am pessimistic. I suspect that we will have to experience massive social dislocation before we manage to find a way to reconcile these competing allegiances.\
 The commentator expresses pessimism about the potential for reconciling the competing allegiances and challenges presented by AI advancements without first experiencing significant social dislocation. Unfortunately, this perspective highlights the difficulties in addressing complex issues arising from technological progress, particularly when they involve deeply ingrained societal structures and values.\
\
It is essential to acknowledge that managing the impact of AI on society will require substantial efforts from various stakeholders, including policymakers, businesses, and individuals. Addressing these challenges proactively, rather than waiting for crisis situations to emerge, can help mitigate potential negative consequences and facilitate a smoother transition towards an AI-driven future.\
\
Collaborative problem-solving and open dialogue among various stakeholders are crucial in finding solutions that balance competing allegiances. Encouraging public participation in discussions about AI ethics, governance, and regulation can help create a more inclusive and informed decision-making process. Additionally, fostering international cooperation and sharing best practices can contribute to addressing global challenges associated with AI advancements.\
\
Ultimately, it is crucial to remain proactive and engaged in shaping the future of AI and its impact on society, rather than adopting a purely reactive approach. By working together, we can strive to minimize social dislocation and find ways to reconcile competing allegiances in a rapidly changing technological landscape.\

Commenting on 11.44:\
\
> Please summarise this argument in 10 bullet points.\
 Here are 10 bullet points summarising the argument presented in the text:\
\
* AI will be able to create art, literature, and other forms of creative expression that are better than those produced by humans.\
* However, there will always be people who want to engage in these activities for personal fulfillment, regardless of whether an AI can do it better or not.\
* The level of motivation needed to sustain artistic and creative pursuits may need to increase as AI becomes more advanced.\
* In the case of education, the motivational aspect is more subtle because a significant proportion of students are motivated by the prospect of earning a living through their education.\
* If there are fewer job opportunities available due to AI, many students may become demotivated.\
* It will be difficult for governments to provide welfare benefits to everyone who is not directly employed by an AI-owned company.\
* Under capitalism, 80% of the wealth will always be owned by 20% of the people, which means that a great many people will be far worse off than the mega-rich.\
* There will be people who do things because they enjoy doing them and not for some ulterior motive.\
* These people will extract as much meaning from their present experiences as they can and that's enough for them.\
* It is impossible to predict where we will be in terms of AI development in one year, let alone 5 or 40 years.\

> What is your assessment of this argument?\
 The argument presented in the text raises some important points about the potential impact of AI on motivation, both in terms of creative pursuits and education. It highlights the fact that while there will always be people who are motivated to engage in artistic and creative activities regardless of whether an AI can do it better or not, many students may become demotivated if there are fewer job opportunities available due to AI.\
\
The argument also acknowledges the difficulty of providing welfare benefits to everyone who is not directly employed by an AI-owned company, and points out that under capitalism, 80% of the wealth will always be owned by 20% of the people, which means that a great many people will be far worse off than the mega-rich.\
\
Overall, the argument highlights the potential for economic and motivational disruption as AI becomes more advanced. However, it also acknowledges that there will always be people who engage in creative pursuits for personal fulfillment, and that these individuals will continue to extract meaning from their present experiences regardless of whether an AI can do it better or not.\
\
While the argument makes some valid points, it is important to note that it is difficult to predict where we will be in terms of AI development in one year, let alone 5 or 40 years. The rate of change and progress in this field is exponential, and it is likely that many new ideas and discoveries will be made in the coming years. Additionally, while the argument acknowledges the potential for economic disruption, it does not offer any concrete solutions for addressing this issue.\
\
In conclusion, the argument presented in the text raises some important points about the potential impact of AI on motivation and economic opportunities, but it is difficult to predict where we will be in terms of AI development in the coming years, and further research and discussion is needed in order to address the potential challenges and opportunities that may arise as a result of advances in this field.\
